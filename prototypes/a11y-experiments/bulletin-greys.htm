Of the Week 37 deaths, 1.1% (97 deaths) involved COVID-19 in England.</p><p>In Wales, the number of deaths increased from 488 in Week 36 to 578 in Week 37, which was one death higher than the five-year average (577). Of these, 0.2% (one death) involved COVID-19.</p><p>In Week 37, in England and Wales, 12.5% of all deaths mentioned "Influenza and Pneumonia", COVID-19 or both, compared with 12.3% in Week 36. "Influenza and Pneumonia" has been included for comparison, as a well-understood cause of death involving respiratory infection that is likely to have somewhat similar risk factors to COVID-19.</p><h4>Figure 2: Deaths not involving COVID-19 increased above the five-year average</h4><p>Number of deaths registered by week, England and Wales, 28 December 2019 to 11 September 2020</p><p><div class="js--show">

<p>The year-to-date analysis shows that, of deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) up to Week 37 (week ending 11 September 2020), 63.4% (33,283 deaths) occurred in hospital, with the remainder occurring in care homes (15,529 deaths), private homes (2,492 deaths), hospices (751 deaths), other communal establishments (224 deaths) and elsewhere (203 deaths).</p><p>Between Weeks 36 and 37, the number of deaths involving COVID-19 increased in hospitals and care homes (by 13 deaths and 10 deaths respectively) and decreased or remained similar in all other settings. Deaths involving COVID-19 in hospitals as a proportion of all deaths in hospitals remained the same as Week 36, at 1.6%. Deaths involving COVID-19 in care homes as a proportion of all deaths in care homes increased from 1.1% in Week 36 to 1.3% in Week 37.

From 10 April (the first day when data were collected using the CQC's new method of identifying deaths involving COVID-19) to 18 September 2020, there were 14,264 deaths of residents in care homes involving COVID-19.

</p><p>Figure 6 is based on date of death for deaths registered up to 19 September 2020, rather than date of registration. This means as more deaths are registered, deaths per day are likely to increase, especially for later dates. Looking at the number of deaths that occurred in Week 37, 69.9% of deaths occurred in hospitals, and care homes accounted for 26.0% of all deaths involving COVID-19; this may change as more deaths are registered.</p><p>A death of a man aged 80 to 84 years was registered in the week ending 4 September 2020 (Week 36), which occurred in the week ending 31 January 2020 (Week 5).

This section will look at the number of deaths by date of death produced by the ONS compared with death notifications reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). For Wales, we can also compare the reconciled DHSC data by date of death released by Public Health Wales (PHW).</p><p>On 12 August 2020, Public Health England (PHE) revised their data series to include two measures: deaths of positively tested individuals where the death occurred within 28 days and deaths within 60 days of a positive test.

The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">comparative number of death notifications</a> reported by the DHSC on GOV.UK where the deaths occurred within 28 days of testing was 36,999 and the number of deaths by date of death showed 36,959; the comparative number of death notifications where the deaths occurred within 60 days of testing was 40,923 and the number of deaths by date of death showed 41,000.</p><p>In Wales, including deaths that occurred up to 11 September 2020 but were registered up to 19 September 2020, of those we have processed so far, the number involving COVID-19 was 2,571; the comparative number of death notifications reported by the DHSC on GOV.UK where the death occurred within 28 days of testing was 1,597 and <a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/">PHW numbers</a>, which come from the same source as the DHSC figures but are continuously updated, also showed 1,603 deaths.</p>

<h3>Coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths</h3><p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths are those deaths registered in England and Wales in the stated week where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings â€“ a positive test result is not required. Definitions of COVID-19 for deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland are similar to England and Wales.</p>

<p>More quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/mortalitystatisticsinenglandandwalesqmi">Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI</a>.</p><p>To meet user needs, we publish very timely but provisional counts of death registrations in England and Wales in our <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales">Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional</a> dataset. These are presented by sex, age group and regions (within England) as well as for Wales as a whole. To allow time for registration and processing, these figures are published 11 days after the week ends. Because of the rapidly changing situation, in this bulletin we have also given provisional updated totals based on the latest available death registrations, up to 19 September 2020. </p><p>Because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, our regular weekly deaths release now provides a separate breakdown of the number of deaths involving COVID-19: that is, where COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, including in combination with other health conditions. If a death certificate mentions COVID-19, it will not always be the main cause of death but may be a contributory factor. This bulletin summarises the latest weekly information and will be updated each week during the pandemic.</p><p>These figures are different from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">daily surveillance figures on COVID-19 deaths</a> published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on the GOV.UK website, for the UK as a whole and its constituent countries. Figures in this report are derived from the formal process of death registration and may include cases where the doctor completing the death certificate diagnosed possible cases of COVID-19, for example, where this was based on relevant symptoms but no test for the virus was conducted.</p><p>From 29 April 2020, the DHSC started to publish as their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">daily announced figures on deaths from COVID-19</a> for the UK a new series that uses improved data for England produced by Public Health England (PHE). These figures provide a count of all deaths where a positive test for COVID-19 has been confirmed, wherever that death has taken place, a change from previously reporting only confirmed COVID-19 deaths in hospitals. Figures for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had already begun to include deaths outside hospitals, so this change ensured that the UK-wide series had a shared and common definitional coverage. A <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/statementsandletters/thedifferentusesoffiguresondeathsfromcovid19publishedbydhscandtheons">statement</a> was published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which provides more detail of the changes.</p><p>On 12 August 2020, the PHE data series was revised to include two measures: deaths of positively tested individuals where the death occurred within 28 days and deaths within 60 days of a positive test. More information on these changes can be found in their <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908781/Technical_Summary_PHE_Data_Series_COVID-19_Deaths_20200812.pdf">technical summary (PDF, 854KB)</a>.</p><p>In contrast to the GOV.UK figures, we include only deaths registered in England and Wales, which is the legal remit of the ONS. Tables 2 and 3 provide an overview of the differences in definitions between sources.</p><p>
